# Cellulase_model
A Random Forest Regressor trained to predict cellulase enzyme yield (Max FPU/mL) from Trichoderma fermentation parameters (e.g., temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen). The model is an ensemble of 300 decision trees, optimized for interpretability and robustness with small-to-medium datasets.
